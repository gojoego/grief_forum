    </p>

    <h2>be respectful to everyone</h2>
    <p>approach every post and poster with empathy, kindness and understanding</p>

    <h2>keep posts focused on your loved ones</h2>
    <p>posts should relate to memories and messages for the loved ones who have passed</p>

    <h2>foster a safe and supportive space</h2>

    <p></p>

    <h2>protect your privacy and that of others</h2>

    <h2>moderation policy</h2>
    <p>moderators may remove content that violates these guidelines to maintain a supportive environment</p>
